 ## I _really_ want a mobile app, though

I'm sorry, but there's not enough incentive for me to keep maintaining a native mobile app. I've heard great things about [PhotoSync](https://www.photosync-app.com/home), though I haven't used it myself. Any WebDav client should work, and if it doesn't, feel free to open an issue at [`bewcloud/bewcloud`](https://github.com/bewcloud/bewcloud).
